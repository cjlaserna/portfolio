				<h1 class="section_title">My First Sites</h1>
				<p> My name is Catherine Laserna. I've been teaching myself how to program since I was 8-years-old.</p> 
				<p>My first <b>horibble</b> website made with HTML, was created when I was about 9 or 10-years-old. It was an attempt to recreate Disney's famous online MMORPG, Pixie Hollow. At the time I was so upset that Disney shut down Toontown and Pixie Hollow, I put my heart into making a 'hate' blog through Google's Blogger and attempting to recreate Pixie Hollow with free web hosting. Although the blog no longer exists, it received well over 3k views in total. The monstrosity that was my "recreation" of Pixie Hollow, received little to no attention. The creation of these sites and the feeling I got making them served as a stepping stone to my CS journey.</p>
				<div class="imgwrapper"><div class="innerimgwrap"><p class="text">This is a clipped gif of an old Youtube video I made that showcased my monstrosity of a website.</p><img src="https://github.com/cjlaserna/portfolio/blob/master/images/final_5e17ee455246c500166faf87_377970.gif?raw=true"></div></div>
				<h1>Hobbies</h1>
				<p>My hobbies outside of programming include playing video games, creating jewelry, video creation, and image manipulation. I make sure to use my skills wisely. I've gotten paid for editing gaming Youtube videos as well as creating Youtube channel banners/icons/intros. Although the videos are now private, I used to make terrible gaming videos/animations when I was 12-years-old, and accumulated 50k views total. I've also sold a couple pieces of jewelry in the past.</p>

				<h1>Passion-Driven Learning</h1>
				<p>The only listed skill I learned that wasn't self-taught was programming in Java. We have such an abundance of resources that allows anyone and everyone with internet access to learn about countless topics. I believe that self-motivation and passion allowed me to get where I am now.</p>
